Outcome dialogue: 

Ansley Smith: 

"The color of the drone is unfortunate because its color blends in with that of the sky, i often lose track of it and then lose time trying to find it.

The size of the drone is small and easy to carry!, however on windy days it is not as stable as previous drones.

Drone was light and easy to carry, but short flying time meant it felt like a lot of work for the brief footage. Although we did get some really great data we couldnâ€™t have got otherwise!"

Davina Murphy: 

"Unfortunately that just our previous drone we had, we are not able to use it under rainy conditions.

Hard to get started using the drone. Mostly only the 2 PhD student researchers were willing to invest time getting competent, we will see if those starting next year also will.

The plastic propellers of the drone make a lot of noise, and on occasion seems to scare off or disturb some of the birds, however the flexibility of the propellers makes the drone less harmful in case of a collision with a bird."

Fiona Wattson: 

"The drone is quite big and cumbersome to carry over long distances, perhaps using foldable propellers would make it easier to carry in a smaller bag.

Drone was light and nimble."

Update after 1 year of use: 
The drone was used near a nesting colony of elegant terns and unfortunately due to the drones short lifespan and high winds that day, we were unable to return the drone in time and it crashed, scaring away the colony and abandoning their eggs!.
